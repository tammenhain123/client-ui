I would like to share with you the process I followed while completing the test you provided. Firstly, I organized my tasks on a Jira board to ensure efficient project management. Next, I defined the project structure and the libraries to be used, aiming for a robust and efficient architecture.

To kick off development, I focused on building the global layout, including elements such as the sidebar menu and screen responsiveness, as well as establishing page structure and defining themes. Then, I concentrated on developing the login module, where I implemented logic to store an access token and the role of the logged-in user in local storage.

After completing the login module, I moved on to creating the dashboard, which displays relevant information about the products in cards. Next, I worked on the products module, where I developed an initial page containing a table with the products and respective actions to view, edit, delete, and add.

I also implemented a modal for adding and editing products, providing a more intuitive user experience. Furthermore, I applied the necessary permissions to all pages, ensuring the security and integrity of the system.

It is important to note that the backend was configured using a JSON Server, providing a realistic simulation of the production environment. Throughout the process, I aimed to keep the project well-componentized, reusing components efficiently and following best development practices.

I am available to provide any additional information or discuss further details about the project.
